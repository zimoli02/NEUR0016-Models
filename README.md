# NEUR0016-Models
This repository contains some neural computation models taught in the NEUR0016 module at UCL. As an undergraduate student majoring in Neuroscience, I wrote these codes out of interest and for the purpose of deepening my understanding of neural computational modelling. The models tend to be very simple and straightforward in presenting some basic ideas (e.g. Delta rule, backpropagation).

This repo welcomes any advice and suggestions.
